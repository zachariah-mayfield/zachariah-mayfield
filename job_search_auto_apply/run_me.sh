# Set up Python Environment
# Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. You can check by running:

python --version

# Install Project Dependencies
# Create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment:
# On Windows:

venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required dependencies using pip and the requirements.txt:

pip install -r requirements.txt

# If you don't have a requirements.txt file, you can create one by running:

pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Set Up Docker (Optional, for containerized setup)
# Running the app in a Docker container, you'll need to have Docker installed. You can find instructions to install Docker on Docker's website.
# https://www.docker.com/get-started

# Build the Docker image:

docker build -t job-search-auto-apply .


# Run the Docker container:

docker run -p 8000:8000 job-search-auto-apply


# Set Up user_profile.json
# The application uses a user_profile.json file for user details to auto-apply for jobs.

# Create a file named user_profile.json in your project directory. 

# Run the FastAPI Application
# To run the FastAPI app (in development mode), use Uvicorn:

uvicorn fastapi_app:app --reload

# This will start the app locally at http://localhost:8000.

# Run the Flask Application (Optional)
# Alternatively, you can run the Flask app:

python flask_app.py

# This will start the Flask app at http://localhost:5000.

# Run the CLI App
# You can also run the CLI application using click:

python cli_app.py

# Test the Application
# Once the FastAPI or Flask server is running, you can test the endpoints or interact with the app via the command line.
# For FastAPI, you can navigate to http://localhost:8000/docs to view the interactive API documentation.
# For Flask, you can use Postman or curl to interact with the API.

# Testing Auto-Apply Functionality
# The auto-apply functionality requires Selenium or Playwright to be configured. Make sure you have the required drivers set up:
# Selenium: Ensure you have the ChromeDriver installed for Selenium, or adjust the code to use the appropriate driver for your browser.
# Playwright: You might need to install Playwright and its dependencies:

pip install playwright
playwright install

# Additional Notes:
# API Keys: If you are using external APIs like geolocation services or job search APIs, you might need API keys. 
# Make sure to configure those in your project as necessary.
# Error Handling: If there are any missing dependencies, incorrect configurations, or other issues, the logs should help you diagnose the problem.
